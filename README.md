# ðŸ©º Diabetes Progression Prediction with Linear Regression
Situation:<br>
Managing diabetes requires understanding how the disease progresses over time. Predicting future progression based on patient data can aid in better treatment and healthcare planning. Scikit-learn provides a built-in diabetes dataset ideal for demonstrating machine learning techniques in medical prediction problems.
<br>
Task:<br>
The objective was to build a simple yet effective machine learning model using Linear Regression to predict the disease progression score based on medical attributes from the Scikit-learn Diabetes dataset.
<br>
Action:<br>
<br>
Utilized Scikit-learnâ€™s load_diabetes() function to access the dataset (10 features + target).<br>
Selected a single feature (e.g., BMI) to build and visualize a univariate linear regression model.<br>
Split the dataset into training and test sets.<br>
Trained a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.<br>
Visualized the regression line over the scatter plot to understand model fit.<br>
Evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score on the test set.<br>
<br>
Result:<br>
<br>
The model was able to capture the trend in disease progression with respect to the selected feature.<br>
Achieved a test MSE of X.XX and RÂ² score of Y.YY (fill these in after running your code).<br>
Created clear visualizations to help understand model performance and fit.<br>
Demonstrated the effectiveness of linear regression as a baseline for medical prediction tasks using real-world-like data.<br>
